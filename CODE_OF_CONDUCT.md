# Medi-Connect Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

At Medi-Connect, we strive to build an inclusive and welcoming community where every contributor feels valued and respected. Whether you're contributing code, reporting an issue, or suggesting new features, we expect everyone to uphold our community standards and work together constructively.

## Our Values

1. **Respect and Empathy**  
   All members of the community should be treated with respect. Be considerate in your interactions, and recognize that people from all walks of life contribute to Medi-Connect. Disrespectful behavior, harassment, or offensive language will not be tolerated.

2. **Collaboration and Openness**  
   We encourage collaboration and open communication. If you encounter a problem, or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Offer help where you can, and foster an environment where ideas and solutions can be freely exchanged.

3. **Constructive Feedback**  
   Feedback is an essential part of collaboration. Provide feedback thoughtfully and with kindness. Be open to receiving feedback on your own contributions. Together, we can improve Medi-Connect through constructive discussions and shared learning.

4. **Inclusivity**  
   We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of their level of experience, background, or identity. Medi-Connect is a space where everyone has the right to contribute and learn without facing discrimination.

5. **Professionalism**  
   Always maintain a professional and friendly attitude in all project-related discussions. Be mindful of your tone and ensure that your communications reflect positively on the project and its contributors.

## Expected Behavior

- Offer and accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Acknowledge when you don’t know something and are open to learning from others.
- Focus on what is best for the community and the project.
- Show patience and understanding when addressing questions or issues.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment or discrimination in any form.
- Use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome advances of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling.
- Threatening or intimidating behavior, either in public or private communications.
- Disruption of the project’s work, community, or contributions.

## Rules to Filter Spammy PRs

To maintain the quality of contributions and avoid spammy pull requests (PRs), we have set the following rules:

- If someone submits a PR without informing about the updates in the corresponding issue, we reserve the right to mark it as **spammy**.
- For GSSoC participants:
  - **Level 1 GSSoC**: PR must include at least 2 files or 20 lines of code.
  - **Level 2 GSSoC**: PR must cover at least 40+ lines of code.
  - **Level 3 GSSoC**: PR must cover at least 60+ lines of code and include changes to 3 or more files.
- For Hacktoberfest participants: As you have a limit of 4 PRs, we encourage tackling larger, more significant issues.
- Avoid rewriting code in a different form without necessity (i.e., only when it's essential).
- Only address problems that are related to your assigned issue.

**Violation of these rules may result in your PR being marked as spammy!** However, we will consult with you before taking any such action.

## Reporting Issues

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project lead:

- **Luson Basumatary**
- **Email:** yuria4489@gmail.com

All reports will be treated with the utmost confidentiality. We are committed to ensuring that the Medi-Connect community remains a safe and respectful place for everyone.

## Enforcement

Any contributor who violates this Code of Conduct may face actions deemed appropriate by the project leadership, including but not limited to warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project.
